This package contains Ruby bindings to the PortAudio api. PortAudio is a cross-
platform interface to your audio hardware.

Although Ruby is too slow for realtime audio computation, these bindings make
it possible to write controllers for the PortAudio system. Audio computation
may be accomplished by supplying a callback function pointer obtained via
Ruby's FFI, or even generated with the author's LLVM bindings at
<http://github.com/jvoorhis/ruby-llvm>.

== Requirements
* PortAudio, version 1.9 or better
* Fairly complete support for Ruby's foreign function interface
